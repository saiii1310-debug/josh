                Life has changed a lot lately from being daddy‚Äôs little girl to becoming the responsible elder daughter‚Ä¶ From the days when mom dressed me up and braided my hair, to today when I find myself doing the same for her ife has quietly turned me from her little girl into her silent support. From sharing toys and silly fights with my sister to holding her hand and guiding her, I see how much has shifted.

                Life now feels exactly how I dreamed as a kid, yet I wish I could relive those days once again‚Ä¶

                I miss going out with daddy wherever he went especially those early morning rides, holding his tummy tight, staring at the warm sunlight with a pleasant breeze me . I miss hanging out with him in his office, where he bought me McDonald‚Äôs Happy Meals, and I loved doodling with markers on his whiteboard. Those were moments I truly enjoyed, moments that felt magical.

                Life was good when I had heavy bags but less pressure.
                ‚ÄúI want to grow up‚Äù might be the dumbest thing I ever said as a kid.

                Although life is good now, I just miss being my parents‚Äô little girl‚Ä¶ I know I still am, but it never feels quite the same anymore. Sometimes, I just want to run back to them no matter what but it‚Äôs not always possible.

                Amma and Nana always gave me everything they never had. One day, I promise I‚Äôll give them back the life they never dared to dream ‚ú®üíô.
